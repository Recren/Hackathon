# Project for HackUTD 2023
Website to buy and sell new/used goods only accessible to college students
The vision for this project was to create a commerce site where people can verify that they go to a certain university and from there, they can buy and sell goods from and to other university students. Meetings would be done on campus during the daytime in populated areas which would ensure the safety of the people participating in the transaction.
There is scalability present here as it can be implement for many university and the only requirement is that they verify themselves using their University email
To run the project, you must open 2 instances of the project, using the terminal within your perferred IDE, use command "cd /backend" and "npm run dev" in one instance of the project. Then use command "cd /frontend" and "npm start" in the other instance. This will run the client side frontend and have it connected to our server and database
