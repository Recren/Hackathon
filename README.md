# Project for HackUTD 2023
Website to buy and sell new/used goods only accessible to college students
The vision for this project was to create a commerce site where people can verify that they go to a certain university and from there, they can buy and sell goods from and to other university students. Meetings would be done on campus during the daytime in populated areas which would ensure the safety of the people participating in the transaction.
There is scalability present here as it can be implement for many university and the only requirement is that they verify themselves using their University email
